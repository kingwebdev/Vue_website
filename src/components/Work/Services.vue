                <h1 class="huge">We're not your typical assembly-line software shop.</h1>
                <p>If you ordered a custom hoodie but were sent one straight off the rack, you'd ask for your money back. So when it comes to custom software, why settle for anything less than a perfect fit?</p>
                <p class="large lightpurple">We recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to software.</p>
                <p>Our talented team of designers and developers works with customers to identify their unique needs, and we pride ourselves on our ability to build custom products that turn digital dreams into reality. Our customers know what their users need, so we don't just drop off our product at the end of a project: we make customers and users an integral part of the development process.</p>

                <h2 class="purple">How we work</h2>
                <p class="large orange">Scrum. Kanban. Extreme Programming.</p>
                <p>We know agile like the back of our hand. Our small, cross-functional agile teams use iterative development cycles to rapidly deliver sleek, intuitive, and responsive software. Building software is a process, and our developers know that project goals are moving targets that shift as customer needs evolve. Adapting to change is baked into our development process, allowing us to deliver software that meets customer and user needs, no matter what.</p>

                <h2 class="purple">What we do</h2> 
                <p class="large orange">Innovate. Create. Disrupt.</p>
                <p>When it comes to software development, we're not afraid to push boundaries. Building sleek visualizations, powerful geospatial infrastructures, and cutting-edge user interfaces, we transform the way users interact with software.</p>
